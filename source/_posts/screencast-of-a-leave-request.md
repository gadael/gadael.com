First user, the employee.

 * First step, he choose the absence period
 * Second step, the user pick in leave right balance to fit the absence duration.

On the second step, there is an overview of the consuption in the second column. Since the user is at 100% attendance, the consumtion is equal to the duration.

After saving the request, the user get back to the request list with the created request in a waiting state.

Second user, the manager.

There is an overview of the waiting requests on the homepage, in the video, the manager also have an absence account but there is an additional menu in the header to access the waiting requests list.
