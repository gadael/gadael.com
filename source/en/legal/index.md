The Service may contain information, data, text, photographs, videos, audio clips, written posts and comments, software, scripts, graphics, and interactive features generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the Service (collectively, “Content”). Subject to these Terms of Service, Gadael.com grants to You and each user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use (i.e., to download and display locally) Content solely for purposes of using the Service. Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any Content for other than purposes of using the Service is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from us. You shall not sell, license, rent, or otherwise use or exploit any Content for commercial use or in any way that violates any third party right. For the purposes of these Terms of Service, “Content” also includes all User Content (as defined below).

A "Gadael.com Account" or "Account" referred to herein means a service, web site, provided by Gadael.com, where You may use Gadael.com to start an application instance with a database and your users data or other materials ("User Content").

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Agreement. In order to use the Service, You must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, You must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and other access device. You also understand and agree that the service may include certain communications from Gadael.com, such as service announcements, administrative messages, etc., and that these communications are considered part of the Service and You will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Gadael.com will provide the Service in accordance with this Agreement. Gadael.com may at its sole discretion modify the features of the Service from time to time without prior notice.


## REGISTRATION

In order to use the Service, You must have a valid Account. To acquire an Account for the Service, You must provide Gadael.com with an electronic mail address and other information ("Registration Data"). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the access data for Your Account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under Your Account. You agree to

(a) immediately notify Gadael.com of any unauthorized use of Your Account or any other breach of security, and
(b) ensure that You exit from Your Account at the end of each session.

Gadael.com cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from Your failure to comply with this section. In consideration of use of the Service, You agree to:

(a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about Yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form, and
(b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.

Gadael.com assumes no duty to verify such information as further detailed in the CONTENT OF THE SERVICE section of these Terms of Service. If You provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Gadael.com has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Gadael.com has the right to suspend or terminate Your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). By using the Service (and registering an Account on the Service), You represent and warrant that You are at least 13 years of age, and no one under the age of 13 may use the Service - except as set forth below under "Kids and Gadael.com". Gadael.com may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms of Service are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you and the right to access the Service is revoked where these Terms of Service or use of the Service is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale or provision of the Service conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation.


## KIDS AND Gadael.com

Gadael.com is not directed to children, and we expect that any use by children will only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials. Gadael.com relies on parents and guardians to ensure that minors only use Gadael.com if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as laid out in these Terms of Service and in our Privacy Policy.


## BILLING/PAYMENT TERMS

Additional groupings of features may be added to the Service and made available to You as a paid upgrade ("Paid Plan"). If You choose to subscribe to a Paid Plan, You shall pay fees (described below) to Gadael.com. Upon selection of a Paid Plan, You will provide Gadael.com with the necessary billing information ("Billing Data").

Credit cards are the only payment mechanism Gadael.com will accept for payment of a monthly or yearly subscription fee ("Subscription Fee") for a Paid Plan. All currency references are in U.S. dollars. Paid Plans can be paid as either a monthly Subscription Fee or a yearly Subscription Fee.

If you select a Paid Plan, You must provide current, complete and accurate Billing Data. You must promptly update all Billing Data to keep Your Account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date) and You must promptly notify Gadael.com if Your Payment Method is changed (for example, for loss or theft) or if You become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of Your name or password. If You fail to provide any of the foregoing information, You agree that Gadael.com may continue charging You for any use of the Paid Plan under your Billing Data unless You have terminated Your Paid Plan as set forth herein.

The credit card that You provide as part of the Billing Data will be automatically and immediately billed on the first Business Day of each Month. You agree that Gadael.com may charge to Your credit card all amounts due and owing for Your Account on that monthly basis or upon cancellation (see "Termination, Breach, Suspension and Cancellation" and "Refund"). Gadael.com will contact You via electronic mail to alert You upon each charge. Gadael.com may change prices at any time, but will endeavor to provide reasonable advance notice via the Gadael.com website and electronic mail. You agree that in the event Gadael.com is unable to collect the fees owed to Gadael.com for Your Account through Your Subscription Fee, your account will be suspended after a one month tolerance period (you will have one month to provide correct credit card informations if the payment fails).

As long as Your Account remains active and in good standing, You will be charged the Subscription Fee even if You never use the service. You may, however, cancel Your Paid Plan at any time.


## TERMINATION, BREACH, SUSPENSION AND CANCELLATION

If Your Subscription Fee payment is overdue, Gadael.com will disable Your access to the features provided by the Paid Plan. Gadael.com may, at its sole discretion, at any time and for any reason, terminate the Service, terminate this Agreement, or suspend or terminate Your Account. In the event of suspension or termination, Your account will be disabled and You may not be granted access to Your Account or any files or other Content (including Your User Content) contained in Your Account, and Gadael.com may delete Your User Content, although residual copies of information may remain in our system for some time for back-up purposes. In the event of termination, Gadael.com may also withdraw and at its discretion reallocate the public web address of Your Account.

If You terminate Your Account, via means provided for cancellation on the Gadael.com website, or via telephone call or electronic mail to Gadael.com, and You request that Gadael.com delete Your User Content and files contained in Your Account, Gadael.com will make all reasonable efforts to do so.


## REFUND

Gadael.com provides means for Account and Paid Plan cancellation on the Gadael.com website. If You cancel Your Account within 90 calendar days of the date of sign up, and You request a refund, Gadael.com will refund all payments You have made to Gadael.com within the 90 calendar days prior to the cancellation and refund request.

## PROPER USE

Gadael.com does not claim ownership over any User Content submitted on or through the Service. Your User Content belongs to You. However, by uploading any User Content to the Service, You agree that Gadael.com may store and display (only to You, to the extent that You make such User Content private) Your User Content solely as necessary in connection with the Service. To the extent You choose to share any of Your User Content with other users of the Service, You agree to allow these users (i.e., only the users you specify) to view Your User Content and, to the extent applicable, collaborate with You and Your User Content.

You understand that all User Content is the sole responsibility of the person from which such User Content originated.

You acknowledge that Gadael.com does not pre-screen User Content, but that Gadael.com and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse, modify or move any Content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Gadael.com and its designees shall have the right to remove any User Content that violates the Agreement or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that You must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.

(a) comply with legal process;

(b) enforce the Agreement;

(c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; or

(d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Gadael.com, its users and the public.

If Gadael.com discloses User Content to comply with legal process or respond to claims that any User Content violates the rights of third-parties, to the extent permitted by law, regulation or legal process, Gadael.com agrees to provide You with prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with You in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure.

You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including Your User Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.

(a) upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available any User Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy (up to, but not excluding any address, email, phone number, or any other contact information without the written consent of the owner of such information), hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;
